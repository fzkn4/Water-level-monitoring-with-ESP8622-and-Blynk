# Automated Water Level Monitoring and Control System using ESP8266 and Blynk
This project presents an Automated Water Level Monitoring and Control System using the ESP8266 microcontroller and Blynk IoT platform, specifically designed to monitor and manage the filling of water tanks or reservoirs.

The primary function of this system is to `keep the water tank adequately filled without manual intervention`. When water falls below a set level, the system automatically activates a water pump to refill the tank, deactivating it once the tank reaches full capacity. Users also have the `option to disable the automatic filling feature when needed`, providing flexibility and control over water usage.
